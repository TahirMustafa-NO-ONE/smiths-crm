Fix the double navbar issue in the smiths-crm Next.js application:

PROBLEM:
The Layout component is being rendered twice - once globally in pages/_app.js and again in every individual page component (dashboard.js, leads/index.js, etc.). This causes duplicate headers/navbars.

SOLUTION:
1. Remove the Layout wrapper from pages/_app.js and keep ONLY the SessionProvider and Component
2. Keep the individual Layout imports in each page file (dashboard.js, leads/index.js, etc.) so the navbar renders only once per page
3. Verify that the navbar appears only once on all pages after making changes
4. Test on multiple pages: /dashboard, /leads, /clients, /contacts to ensure no duplication

AFFECTED FILES:
- pages/_app.js (remove Layout wrapper)
- All page files will keep their Layout imports: pages/dashboard.js, pages/leads/index.js, pages/clients/index.js, etc.

The navbar should render exactly once on every page after this fix.
